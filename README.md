### README

Briefly, Project 1 uses a 'fitbit' device, or something similar. Over 2 months, for each 24hr period, steps are counted. Every day, there will be 288 readings at 5 minute intervals, downloaded from the device. For 2 months, that's 61 days of 288 measurements for a total of 17568 count readings. This exercise will be to investigate activity, raw and averaged, for interesting behavior. Ultimately, to also see if weekday is different from weekend.
